# QABE: A Framework for quantum annealer programming and benchmarking
This repository contains source code for the work "QABE: a Framework for Quantum Annealer Programming and Benchmarking".
This work presents QABE: a framework for automatic programming and benchmarking of quantum annealers through a high-level interface, that allows non expert users to formulate specific optimization problems in terms of variables and constraints, and enables for automatic benchmarking of the quantum annealer. 

## Code Description
Under the names "ProblemName".py are the files containing the necessary functions to run specific instances of those problems through user input. Each problem needs to be created, prepared and then sampled using the homonymous methods. Alternatively, it is possible to use the set of "testingProblemName".py files, which offer a predefined format of problem creation, preparation and sampling for a direct benchmarking of D-Wave Annealers.
